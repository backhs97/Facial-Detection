# Facial-Detection

## Instruction:

pip install flask

pip install flask opencv-python tensorflow numpy 

pip install tensorflow


## run command:


python app.py


## Dummy test run command:


python create_dummy_model.py



## Datasets:

## Libraries: You’ll need libraries like:

OpenCV: For facial detection. (Load a pre-trained face detection model, e.g., haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml in OpenCV.)

TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training your neural network model.

Dlib: For more advanced face detection and facial landmarks.

Flask: If you’re building the web application in Python.

React/Angular/Vue: For the frontend if you want a modern web interface.


## Model Architecture(NEED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS):

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Typically used for image recognition tasks.

Transfer Learning: You can use a pre-trained model like VGG16 or ResNet and fine-tune it on your emotion dataset.



## Integrate with Your Web Application(Later):

Backend API: Create an API endpoint using Flask that accepts an image(real time ig), processes it, and returns the detected emotion.

Real-time Emotion Detection: Use WebRTC for real-time video streaming. Continuously capture frames, send them to the backend, and display the emotion overlay on the video stream.

Frontend: Build a frontend interface where users can upload images or use their webcam. Use JavaScript to send the image to the backend API and display the detected emotion.


## Deploy the Application: 

Hosting: Use cloud services like AWS to host your web application. (MAYBE HUGE)

Scaling: Ensure the application can handle multiple users simultaneously, potentially using Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration.
